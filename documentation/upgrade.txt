Each release has its own file in the upgrade folder.
Basic flow would be to extract the new release and copy over the following files and directories:
```
webclient/config/
webclient/lib/
webclient/view/
webclient/.htaccess
webclient/api.php
webclient/index.php
```

In those files there are the steps needed to make an upgrade.

If you upgrade multiple versions make sure to read all the files in the correct order.

Within the upgrade files itself there is an order. Make sure to follow.
