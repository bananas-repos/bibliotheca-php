Bibliotheca provides a set of fields which can be used to define which data an entry in your collection
can be saved.
Those field definitions are stored in the DB itself and can currently only managed there. But only of
you know how.

Each collection can have there own set of fields. But at least the title field should be available.
Fields can be managed after a collection has been created.


# If you want to create new ones here is an explanation how they work
A field is defined in the sys_fields table. It needs a _saveField and optinal _loadFieldValue method
in manageentry.class and the _loadFieldValue also in mancubus.class
HTML definitions are needed in view/UI_THEME/entry and view/UI_THEME/manageentry
Modification on advancedsearch.php if search needs some special treatment for this field

The 32 is the ID from the target field.
